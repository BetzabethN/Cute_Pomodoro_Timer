# Cute Pomodoro Timer
Cute pomodoro timer to help you focus on your studies or work.

Pressing 'Start' will start one cycle of a 25 minute Pomodoro timer and a 5 minute break.
In case you get distracted, or feel you did not focus enough, you can always restart the timer by pressing 'Restart'.

#### Why I Created This
To be more productive while studying, I wanted to create a habit of using the Pomodoro technique. However, all the timers I found online where very boring/unappealing to me so I decided to create a cute Pomodoro timer to motivate me to study hard.
